// In this lab, you will build a function that checks if a value is classified as a boolean primitive.

// Boolean primitives are true and false.

// Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

// User Stories:

// You should have a function called booWho that receives one argument.
// If the argument received is a boolean primitive, the function should return true.
// If the argument is any other value, the function should return false.

const booWho = (arg) => {
  if (typeof arg == 'boolean') {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};
