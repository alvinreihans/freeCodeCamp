# FreeCodeCamp Labs

This repository is my documentation of FreeCodeCamp Labs which I completed on my journey on FreeCodeCamp.

This repository is created to track my learning progress and to see how I solve problems.

Too many GPT's and vibe coding make me feel that I lost my basic knowledge on JavaScript and SQL, so I intended to relearn it.

_Back to basics: Rebuilding the foundation, one lab at a time._

**Note:**
I decided to put the code to GitHub in the middle of the course, which is why some of the code folders might be empty.
